👋 Hi, I’m @anfelvas (Andrés Felipe Vásquez)  
🧪🌱  Computational biochemist | Natural product innovation 
🌎 Based at Computational Chemistry Group – IPB Halle (Germany) 

👀 I’m currently interested in:
- AI-powered cheminformatics & explainable models
- Natural products and chemical space expansion
- Biodiversity-linked drug discovery and science diplomacy
- AI/ML for retrosynthesis and pharmacophore modeling
- Metabolomics and biosynthetic gene cluster mining for NP discovery 🔬🧬

📖🧬 I’m currently working on:
- Simulation of carbohydrate-based microgels for agricultural applications, with focus on force field merging strategies (GLYCAM + GAFF2) in MD simulations
- Fragment-based drug discovery (FBLD) approaches for drug design and discovery
- Chemodiversity and chemical space modeling
- A One Health knowledge graph connecting plants, natural products, and diseases
- Knowledge graph–driven drug discovery 🧠🔗
- Linking chemodiversity and biodiversity for bioeconomic innovation
- Science-policy interface for biodiversity and bioeconomy  

🤝 I’m open to collaborations in:
- Bioprospecting from plants, fungi, bacteria, and marine organisms 🌿🧫🌊
- Natural product–inspired compound design and optimization 💊🧪
- Structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening
- Omics-guided drug discovery & biodiversity informatics
- Ethnopharmacology, chemical ecology, and traditional knowledge integration
- Post-extraction recovery and habitat restoration (reforesting ecology)
- Development of novel government-advised strategies and policy briefs on bioprospecting, medical prescribing practices, and science education
