👋 Hi, I’m @anfelvas (Andrés Felipe Vásquez)  
🔬 Computational biochemist | Natural product innovation 
🌎 Based at IPB-Halle (Germany) 

👀 I’m interested in:
- AI-powered cheminformatics & explainable models
- Natural products and chemical space expansion
- Biodiversity-linked drug discovery and science diplomacy

🌱 I’m currently working on:
- Simulation of carbohydrate-based microgels for agricultural applications, with focus on force field merging strategies (e.g., GLYCAM + GAFF2) in molecular dynamics
- A One Health knowledge graph connecting plants, natural products, and diseases  
- Linking chemodiversity and biodiversity for bioeconomic innovation  

🤝 I’m open to collaborations in:
- Bioprospecting from plants, fungi, bacteria, and marine organisms 🌿🧫🌊
- Natural product–inspired compound design 💊
- Structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening
- Fragment-based drug discovery (FBLD)
- Chemodiversity and chemical space modeling
- AI/ML for retrosynthesis and pharmacophore modeling
- Knowledge graph–driven drug discovery 🧠🔗
- Omics-guided drug discovery & biodiversity informatics
- Science-policy interface for biodiversity and bioeconomy
